# DeepFake Detection

Repository for work on my Master's Thesis project. The goal is to examine state-of-the-art methods for face swap detection and look to develop something new and possibly better.

# Project Contents

* models/ - definitions for different types of pytorch models to be tested

* tools/ - module of tools/functions created for the purpose of the project

* unit_tests/ - tests for various implemented functions, which can be run after navigating to the directory

# ToDo:

* Handling frames without detected faces
